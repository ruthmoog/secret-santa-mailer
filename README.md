# Secret Santa Mailer

Use the Secret Santa Mailer to manage your secret santa gift-giving!
Given a list of contact, Secret Santa Mailer will randomly match up each person with someone who needs a gift, and drop them a message to let them know.

## To Do List

- pair up the names randomly, so that every giver has a receiver, but the giver and receiver are not the same person
- match santa givers so that they have a name & associated email address
<!-- - shuffle the order so they are random (and not the order given) -->
<!-- - create a new array of givers, by shifting the order of the random givers by 1 place -->
- print a list of the givers and their pairs to make sure it works
- email each giver with the name of their receiver
- read a file (which contains the name and email addresses of the secret santas)
- receive input via a webform instead of a file
